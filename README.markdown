# IT Portfolio Hub

Welcome to **IT Portfolio Hub**, a web application designed to help IT professionals create, manage, and share their portfolios with potential employers. Built with modern web technologies, this project allows users to showcase their skills, projects, and experience in an interactive and customizable way.

## Overview

IT Portfolio Hub is a single-page application that enables users to:
- Sign up and log in to manage their personal profiles.
- Create and edit portfolios with details like skills, projects, and contact information.
- Upload project files, including support for Excel (.xlsx) data.
- Select a professional role to highlight their expertise.
- Share a unique portfolio link with employers.

The app features a clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and is powered by Vue.js for a dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up functionality.
- **Portfolio Creation**: Add and edit personal details, skills, projects, and experience.
- **File Uploads**: Upload profile images and project files, with potential XLSX file processing.
- **Role Selection**: Choose from a list of IT roles (e.g., Developer, Designer, Data Analyst).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Vue.js for smooth navigation and real-time updates.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Internet connection (for CDN-hosted libraries: Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome).

No local server or additional dependencies are required, as the app runs client-side with CDN-hosted resources.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/it-portfolio-hub.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd it-portfolio-hub
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the application. No build step is needed since it uses CDN-hosted libraries.

## Usage

1. **Initial Access**: Open `index.html` in a browser. The app defaults to the "Home" tab.
2. **Sign Up/Login**: Click "Sign In" from the Home tab, then choose to create an account or log in with existing credentials.
3. **Create Portfolio**: After logging in, navigate to "Edit Portfolio" to input your details, upload files, and select a role.
4. **Save and Share**: Save your portfolio to generate a shareable link, which you can copy and distribute.
5. **Explore Tabs**: Use the navigation to view Employers, Contact, or About sections.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the app structure and Vue.js logic.
- (No additional files are included, as this is a single-file project relying on CDNs.)
